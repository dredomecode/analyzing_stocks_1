# analyzing_stocks_1
This project aims to analyze and compare the monthly stock returns of two major e-commerce companies - Amazon and eBay. We conduct a visual examination of the return data by creating a series of plots: line graphs, bar graphs, and scatter plots, using Python's data visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.
